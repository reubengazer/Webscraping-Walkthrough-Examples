    "**Motivation of our Example Walkthrough**\n",
    "\n",
    "I needed to retrieve information about the hours of operation of ~200 Fountain Tire branches for a deep dive. For reasons related to inconsistencies in returned HTML documents and problems scraping from the Google Search page (they want you to use their API), I had to do some retrieval through the Fountain Tire website.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To retrieve the hours of operation for a Fountain Tire branch via their website, I needed to:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- open up the Fountain Tire website\n",
    "- go to the Store Locator\n",
    "- search a specific branch by its address in a search box and click \"submit\" \n",
    "- click the top result returned on the following page to select it\n",
    "- click another button to expand the CSS element showing the hours of operation\n",
    "\n",
    "...for a few hundred Fountain Tire branches! Surely this could be automated. Using _selenium_ we can click around, submit text into boxes, expand page elements, as well as do regular scraping of content once we've arrived at the desired page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this example, we will do a similar procedure on the CBC news website.**  "
