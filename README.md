# Webscraping: Introduction and Example Walkthrough

In this repository, you can learn how to perform simple webscraping using the python package _Selenium_.

**FIRST**: Read through _webscraping-introduction.md_. This motivates why I chose to use Selenium over just the _requests_ package.   
**SECOND**: Read through _webscraping-example-walkthrough.md_. This is a step-by-step example of scraping weather data for cities in Alberta.  
**THIRD**: Download _just_ the code to do the weather-data-scraping in _alberta-weather-webscraping-code.py_.  

**Notes**: If you want a jupyter notebook to work through the example walkthrough, they reside in the Notebooks-to-Download folder.
