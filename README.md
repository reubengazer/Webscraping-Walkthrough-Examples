# Webscraping: Introduction and Example Walkthrough

In this repository, you can learn how to perform simple webscraping using the python package _selenium_ and _lxml_.

There are currently two fully worked examples:

**Webscraping-Albertan-Weather** : Start here! Simple HTML page retrieval and scraping of content.  
**Webscraping-AltaML-CBC-Article** : Go here next! More complex tasks including point-and-clicking, text submission in a browser programmatically.

**Each of these examples has 3 files inside:**

- a Markdown file to read through (nicely formatted for the eyes!)
- a jupyter notebook to work through (these notebooks render poorly in Github - download it!)
- a pure python file with **only** the source code that can be run as a stand-alone file

We will use two packages to complete this work, _lxml_ and _selenium_. See relevant info below.
